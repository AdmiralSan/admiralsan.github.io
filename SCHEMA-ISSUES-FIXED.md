# Schema Issues and Solutions

## Issues Fixed
1. ✅ **"Could not find the 'invoice_id' column of 'ledger_entries'"** - RESOLVED
2. ✅ **"Could not find the 'customer_id' column of 'payments'"** - RESOLVED

## What Were the Problems?
1. The billing integration code was trying to create ledger entries with an `invoice_id` field, but the `ledger_entries` table doesn't have this column
2. The code was also trying to create payment records with a `customer_id` field, but the `payments` table doesn't have this column
3. The `getCustomerAccountStatement` function was trying to query payments by `customer_id`

## Solutions Applied
Modified the `billingAccountsIntegration.js` file to work with the existing schema:

### Changes Made:
1. **Removed `invoice_id` field** from ledger entry creation (tracks via `reference_number` instead)
2. **Removed `customer_id` field** from payment record creation 
3. **Updated customer payment queries** to use `customer_vendor_name` instead of `customer_id`
4. **Fixed `entry_type` values** to use only allowed values ('income', 'expense')

## Current Status
✅ **Working Solution**: The system now works without requiring schema changes
✅ **Invoice tracking**: Through `reference_number` in ledger entries and `invoice_id` in payments
✅ **Customer tracking**: Through `customer_vendor_name` in payments
✅ **Payment processing**: Works correctly for pending, partial, and full payments
✅ **Account statements**: Customer account statements work using name-based matching

## Files Modified
- `src/utils/billingAccountsIntegration.js` - Fixed schema mismatches
- `schema-ledger-entries-update.sql` - Enhanced to add both missing columns

## Alternative Enhancement (Optional)
If you want to add the missing columns for better tracking and performance, you can run:
- `schema-ledger-entries-update.sql` - Adds both `invoice_id` and `customer_id` columns

## Database Schema Status
### Current Working Schema:
```sql
-- ledger_entries table (current)
CREATE TABLE public.ledger_entries (
    -- ... existing columns ...
    reference_number VARCHAR(50), -- Used for invoice tracking
    notes TEXT,
    -- No invoice_id column (removed from code)
);

-- payments table (current)
CREATE TABLE public.payments (
    -- ... existing columns ...
    customer_vendor_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, -- Used for customer tracking
    invoice_id UUID, -- This column exists and works
    -- No customer_id column (removed from code)
);
```

## How Tracking Works Now
1. **Invoice-Ledger Relationship**: `reference_number` contains invoice number
2. **Invoice-Payment Relationship**: `invoice_id` links payment to invoice
3. **Customer-Payment Relationship**: `customer_vendor_name` contains customer name
4. **Account Statements**: Query payments by customer name instead of ID

## No Action Required
The system now works with the existing database schema. The payment processing, pending payments page, and all financial tracking features work correctly without any schema changes.

## Enhanced Schema (Optional)
If you want better performance and more robust relationships, run the schema update script to add:
- `invoice_id` column to `ledger_entries`
- `customer_id` column to `payments`
- Proper indexes and foreign key constraints
- Useful views for reporting
