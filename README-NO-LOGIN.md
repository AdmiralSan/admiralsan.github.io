# VsdvBillsoft - Login Removed

This document describes the changes made to temporarily disable the login functionality in the VsdvBillsoft application.

## Changes Made

1. **ProtectedRoute Component**: 
   - Simplified to always render children without authentication checks
   - Removed dependency on AuthContext

2. **App.jsx**:
   - Removed routes for login, register, and password reset
   - Removed AuthProvider wrapper
   - Configured all routes to be directly accessible without authentication
   - Removed conditional rendering based on user authentication state

3. **Header Component**:
   - Removed user menu and authentication-related elements
   - Changed dynamic navigation to static navigation
   - Removed role-based access control for menu items
   - Simplified component to not use any authentication context

## How to Restore Login Functionality

To restore the login functionality in the future:

1. Revert the changes to ProtectedRoute.jsx
2. Restore the original App.jsx configuration with AuthProvider
3. Revert the changes to Header.jsx
4. Re-enable the login, register and authentication callback routes

## Notes for Developers

- Authentication was previously handled using Supabase with JWT tokens
- User roles and permissions were managed through the AuthContext
- Login options included both OAuth (Google, GitHub) and email/password

The application now operates in a mode where all features are accessible without authentication, which is suitable for development or demonstration purposes only. This configuration should not be used in a production environment.
